  <h1>Donate to a Good Cause</h1>

  <p>
    Amidst natural disasters, rising prices, ongoing conflicts and shrinking
    economies, many refugee and displaced families are forced to choose between
    eating or heating, paying rent or buying life saving medicines.  In the
    aftermath of the tragic earthquakes in Syria and Türkiye, thousands of
    survivors are struggling and in need of food, shelter and life-saving aid.
    You have the power to change this. You have the power to help. Your donation
    today is their lifeline, a beacon of hope in an otherwise hopeless
    situation.

    Section 80G of the Indian Income Tax Act allows a tax deduction for
    contributions to certain relief funds and charitable institutions. Thus, you
    can claim tax deductions in Section 80G apart from Section 80C and save
    maximum taxes
