    <h1></i>About Us</i></h1>
    <p>We are a group of young sophomores trying to prevent and alleviate human suffering in the face of emergencies
        by mobilizing the power of volunteers and the generosity of donors.</p>
    <p>We through our strong network of volunteers, donors and partners, are always there in times of need. We aspire to turn compassion into action so that 
            all people affected by disaster  across the country and around the world receive care, shelter and hope;
    <p>our communities are ready and prepared for disasters;</p>
    <p>We wish everyone in our country has access to safe, lifesaving blood and blood products;</p>
    <p>all members of our armed services and their families find support and comfort whenever needed; and 
    in an emergency, there are always trained individuals nearby, ready to use their gifts earned from hard traing to save lives.
