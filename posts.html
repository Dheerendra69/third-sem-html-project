            <h3>Flood :Before ,During and after</h3>
            <p>
              Flooding is a temporary overflow of water onto land that is
              normally dry. Floods can result from rain, snow, coastal storms,
              storm surges, overflows of rivers, and dam failure. Floods can be
              dangerous...

            <h3>What is Flood!</h3>
            <p>
              A flood happens when water overflows or soaks land that is
              normally dry. There are few places on Earth where people don’t
              need to be concerned about flooding. Generally, floods take hours
              or even days to develop, giving residents time to prepare or
              evacuate. Sometimes, floods develop quickly and with little
              warning.

            <h3>Can you drink 30 days of water in a day? Earth can't either</h3>
            <p>
              On an average day in September, Bengaluru receives about 7mm rain.
              Now, imagine what happens when rain 19 times that volume is flung
              at it in one day. On September 5, Bengaluru got 130mm of rain in a
              day — it's supposed to get an average 212mm for the entire month.
              The city has been floundering since then.
